# Introduction
In the 5th semester I completed databases university course. Course consist of a few laboratory classes with different subjects. After each classes there were exercise - some of them were complex (for example Hibernate homework demanded doing mini web shop with GUI), some were simpler. In subfolders there are exhaustive reports containing code explanation and screenshots.
